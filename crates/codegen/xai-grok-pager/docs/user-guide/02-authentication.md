# Authentication

The Cook CLI supports browser login, API keys, enterprise single sign-on
(SSO), and external auth providers for automation. This page covers the CLI.
In Let Cook, connect a provider from the first-run screen or **Settings →
Models**; see the [Desktop App Reference](29-desktop-reference.md#first-launch).

---

## Browser Login (Default)

On first launch, Cook can open your browser to sign in with the configured
provider:

```bash
cook
```

Cook stores credentials in `~/.cook/auth.json` and reuses them across sessions. Cook refreshes access tokens automatically in the background. When a token can't be refreshed, Cook prompts you to sign in again. Credentials without a server-provided expiry fall back to a 30-day lifetime.

### Credential storage

Tokens in `~/.cook/auth.json` (and MCP OAuth tokens in `~/.cook/mcp_credentials.json`) are written with owner-only permissions (`0600` on Unix). Anyone with filesystem access to those paths can use the credentials, so:

- Prefer full-disk encryption (FileVault, BitLocker, LUKS, or equivalent).
- Do not copy `auth.json` or `mcp_credentials.json` into shared directories, tickets, or chat.
- On multi-user hosts, keep `$HOME` / `$GROK_HOME` private to your account.

### Re-authenticate

To switch accounts or resolve an authentication problem, run:

```bash
cook login
```

Running `cook login` starts the sign-in flow again, replacing your cached session. By default, it opens your browser and signs in through upstream provider OAuth at `auth.x.ai`. Pass a flag to select a different flow:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--oauth` | Sign in through upstream provider OAuth at `auth.x.ai`. This is the default, so the flag is optional. |
| `--device-auth` (alias `--device-code`) | Sign in with the device-code flow for headless or remote environments. |

To sign out, run `cook logout`. It takes no flags and clears your cached credentials.

---

## API Key

For CI/CD, automation, or environments without browser access, use an API key from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai):

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."
cook
```

Cook uses the API key as a fallback when no session token is active. If you have already signed in interactively, the stored session token takes precedence. To fall back to the API key, run `cook logout` or delete `~/.cook/auth.json`.

---

## OIDC (Customer SSO)

Authenticate developers through your own Identity Provider (IdP) -- such as Okta, Azure AD, or Auth0 -- instead of grok.com.

### 1. Register a public client in your IdP

- Grant type: Authorization Code with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1/callback` -- a loopback address. Cook binds a random port at sign-in time, and most IdPs treat the loopback redirect as port-agnostic per [RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252).
- No client secret. PKCE replaces it.

### 2. Configure the CLI

Via config file:

```toml
# ~/.cook/config.toml
[grok_com_config.oidc]
issuer = "https://acme.okta.com"
client_id = "0oa1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9"
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export GROK_OIDC_ISSUER="https://acme.okta.com"
export GROK_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9"
```

You can also override the API endpoint to point at your own proxy:

```bash
export GROK_CLI_CHAT_PROXY_BASE_URL="https://grok-proxy.acme.com/v1"
```

### 3. Run `cook`

The CLI discovers endpoints via `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, opens the IdP login page, and stores tokens in `~/.cook/auth.json`. Tokens auto-refresh silently via the stored `refresh_token`.

### Optional fields

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `scopes` | `["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access", "api:access"]` | `offline_access` enables silent token refresh |
| `audience` | None | Required by some IdPs (e.g., Auth0) |

---

## External Auth Provider

When browser-based login isn't possible -- for example, on sandboxed VMs, CI runners, or air-gapped networks -- delegate authentication to an external binary or script.

### How It Works

```
+--------------+     sh -c     +------------------------+
|     Cook     |-------------->|  your auth binary      |
|              |               |                        |
|  reads       |<-- stdout ----|  prints token          |
|  auth.json   |               |                        |
|              |   (stderr)    |  prints status/URLs    |--> surfaced to user
+--------------+               +------------------------+
```

1. Cook runs your command via `sh -c "<command>"`
2. Your binary runs whatever auth flow it needs (SSO, device code, certificate exchange)
3. **stderr** carries human-readable output, such as login URLs and status messages. Cook reads stderr and surfaces it to the user; in the TUI, it turns the first `https://` URL into a clickable sign-in link.
4. **stdout** is captured by Cook and saved as the access token
5. Exit 0 = success; exit non-zero = Cook falls back to interactive login

### The stdout / stderr Contract

| Stream | What to print | Who sees it |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **stdout** | The token -- nothing else | Cook (parsed and stored in auth.json) |
| **stderr** | Login URLs, status messages, errors | The user (Cook reads stderr and shows the sign-in URL as a clickable link in the TUI) |

**Do not print anything to stdout except the token.** No progress messages, no debug output. Cook reads stdout, trims surrounding whitespace, and parses the result as a token.

### stdout Token Format

**Bare string** -- just the raw token:

```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...
```

**JSON** -- with optional refresh token, expiry, and issuer:

```json
{"access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...", "refresh_token": "ref-tok", "expires_in": 3600, "issuer": "https://idp.example.com"}
```

Use JSON if your tokens expire and you want Cook to automatically re-run the binary before expiry.

JSON fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `access_token` | yes | Bearer token Cook sends to the xAI API |
| `refresh_token` | no | Stored for reference. Cook refreshes by re-running your binary, not with an OAuth refresh grant |
| `expires_in` | no | Token lifetime in seconds; enables proactive refresh before expiry |
| `issuer` | no | Identifies the token's issuer |

### Configuration

Via config file:

```toml
# ~/.cook/config.toml
[auth]
auth_provider_command = "/usr/local/bin/my-auth-provider"
auth_provider_label = "Acme Corp"   # optional -- customizes the TUI login button
auth_token_ttl = 3600               # optional -- token lifetime in seconds
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export GROK_AUTH_PROVIDER_COMMAND="/usr/local/bin/my-auth-provider"
export GROK_AUTH_PROVIDER_LABEL="Acme Corp"
export GROK_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL=3600
```

### Token Refresh

Cook runs your binary on two different contracts, and `GROK_AUTH_EXPIRED` is how
it tells them apart. Each run fully replaces the stored credential, so emit the
same JSON fields (such as `issuer`) on every invocation, including refreshes.

- **`GROK_AUTH_EXPIRED=1` — a headless refresh.** Cook is re-minting over a
  credential it already holds: a near-expiry rotation, or a token the server
  rejected. Nobody is watching. stdin is closed, your stderr is swallowed, and
  the binary is given a few seconds before it is killed. Mint silently or exit
  non-zero — never block.
- **Unset — a sign-in.** `cook login`, the sign-in screen, or the escalation
  Cook performs when a headless run couldn't mint. A user is waiting, your
  stderr reaches them, and you have 300 seconds — enough for a browser round
  trip or a device code.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$GROK_AUTH_EXPIRED" = "1" ]; then
    # Headless: silent refresh only. Declining is the fast, correct answer
    # when your SSO session has lapsed and only the user can renew it.
    echo "Refreshing token..." >&2
    TOKEN=$(my-company-auth --refresh --silent) || exit 1
else
    echo "Authenticating via Acme Corp SSO..." >&2
    TOKEN=$(my-company-auth --login --interactive)
fi

if [ -z "$TOKEN" ]; then
    echo "Authentication failed" >&2
    exit 1
fi

echo "{\"access_token\": \"$TOKEN\", \"expires_in\": 3600}"
```

When the headless run can't produce a token, Cook stops treating the stored
credential as usable and starts the sign-in flow instead — the same one you get
on a machine that has never signed in, with your binary's stderr shown, so a
device-code URL or a browser prompt reaches you. Exiting promptly on
`GROK_AUTH_EXPIRED=1` is what makes that handover fast; a binary that blocks
instead makes you wait out the refresh timeout on every start. Mid-session, the
turn fails with a re-auth prompt and `/login` re-runs the binary interactively.

One case stays ambiguous, and only in **leader mode** (`--leader`, or
`[cli] use_leader = true`; off by default): with no credential at all, the
leader makes one extra attempt in the background just after startup, and that
run has the variable unset, like a sign-in. A binary that mints without help
(service account, keytab, mounted token) succeeds there and the session heals
itself. One that must prompt just sits, up to the 300s sign-in ceiling —
nothing waits on it, the sign-in screen is already up, and that run's stderr
goes to `~/.cook/leader.log` rather than to you.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GROK_AUTH_PROVIDER_COMMAND` | Path to your auth binary |
| `GROK_AUTH_PROVIDER_LABEL` | Display name on the TUI login screen (e.g., "Acme Corp") |
| `GROK_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL` | Token lifetime in seconds (for bare-string tokens without `expires_in`) |
| `GROK_AUTH_EXPIRED` | Set to `1` on a headless refresh: don't prompt, and don't hand back a cached token. Unset on a sign-in, where a user is attached |
| `GROK_AUTH_EARLY_INVALIDATION_SECS` | Seconds before expiry to proactively refresh (default: 300) |

---

## Device Code Flow

For headless environments (SSH sessions, Docker containers, remote VMs) where no browser is available locally:

```bash
cook login --device-auth    # or: cook login --device-code
```

This prints a URL and code to the terminal. Open the URL on any device, enter the code, and complete authentication. Cook polls until the login is confirmed.

You can also implement the device-code flow through an [External Auth Provider](#external-auth-provider) for full control.

---

## Automatic Credential Refresh

Cook automatically refreshes expired credentials:

- **Before expiry:** If your auth provider returned `expires_in` (JSON output) or you set `auth_token_ttl`, Cook re-runs the auth binary ~5 minutes before expiry.
- **On auth error:** If the server returns 401 Unauthorized, Cook refreshes the credentials and retries the request.
- **OIDC:** If a `refresh_token` is available, Cook silently refreshes via your IdP without re-opening the browser.

Tune the refresh buffer:

```bash
# Refresh 5 minutes before expiry (default)
export GROK_AUTH_EARLY_INVALIDATION_SECS=300

# Disable the proactive buffer: refresh at expiry or on a 401 (set to 0)
export GROK_AUTH_EARLY_INVALIDATION_SECS=0
```

---

## Hot Reload

Cook picks up changes to `~/.cook/auth.json` automatically. If you update credentials externally (for example, with a script that writes new tokens), Cook uses the new credentials on the next API call without a restart.

---

## Auth Precedence

Cook resolves credentials for each request in this order, highest to lowest:

1. **Per-model `api_key` or `env_key`** -- set under `[model.<name>]` in `config.toml`. Wins whenever present.
2. **Active session token** -- obtained through browser, OIDC/OAuth2, or external-provider login and stored in `~/.cook/auth.json`.
3. **`XAI_API_KEY`** -- fallback when no session token is active.

When more than one login flow is configured, Cook populates the session token from the first available source, highest to lowest:

1. **External auth provider** (`auth_provider_command`)
2. **Enterprise OIDC** -- when OIDC is configured, through `[grok_com_config.oidc]` in `config.toml` or the `GROK_OIDC_ISSUER` and `GROK_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` environment variables
3. **upstream provider OAuth2 browser login** -- the default

During a session, the active method handles all mid-session refreshes.

## Grove Git credentials (separate from Cook sign-in)


**`~/.cook/auth.json` is never read for Git.** `cook login` does not create a Git credential and `cook logout` does not revoke one; the daemon builds its own credential cell from `auth_mode` in Grove config. Those credentials are managed with `grove status` and `grove reload-credentials` -- see [Grove clone](27-grok-clone.md#authentication) for the failure classes and their next steps.

## Related settings

Coding-data sharing — **Coding data, retention, and training** in Settings,
which `/privacy` opens — does not change these config knobs:

| Setting | How to set it |
|---------|---------------|
| `[features] telemetry` | `config.toml` or `GROK_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` |
| `[telemetry] trace_upload` | `config.toml` or `GROK_TELEMETRY_TRACE_UPLOAD` |
| External OpenTelemetry | `GROK_EXTERNAL_OTEL` / `[telemetry] otel_*`. See [Monitoring Usage](24-monitoring-usage.md). |

On team accounts, only a team admin can change coding-data sharing.
Team admins can also enable or disable Zero Data Retention (ZDR) for their team.
See [How to enable ZDR](https://docs.x.ai/developers/faq/security#how-to-enable-zdr).
When ZDR is on, coding-data sharing cannot be changed at all — the settings
row shows `ZDR` in place of the value. ZDR does not turn off external OTEL
or `user.email` — see [ZDR and this stream](24-monitoring-usage.md#zdr-and-this-stream).

See [Monitoring Usage](24-monitoring-usage.md#related-settings) and [Configuration](05-configuration.md#telemetry).

## Troubleshooting

### Debug logging

Set `RUST_LOG` to control the verbosity of the file log and headless stderr output. (The TUI's on-screen tracing pane uses a fixed filter and ignores `RUST_LOG`.) In the TUI, file logging defaults to `DEBUG`; in headless mode (`-p`), `RUST_LOG` defaults to `off` so only the answer is printed — set `RUST_LOG=error` (or broader) to see logs on stderr.

In the TUI, set `GROK_LOG_FILE` to an absolute path to write logs to that file:

```bash
GROK_LOG_FILE=/tmp/cook.log RUST_LOG=debug cook
tail -f /tmp/cook.log
```

`GROK_LOG_FILE` is treated as a literal file path. A relative value such as `1` writes a file named `1` in the current directory.

In headless mode, logs go to stderr. Redirect them to a file:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cook -p "hello" 2> /tmp/cook.log
```

### Common log messages

| Log message | What it means |
|-------------|---------------|
| `auth: running external auth provider (headless refresh)` / `(interactive login)` | Cook is running your binary, and on which contract |
| `auth: external auth provider returned fresh token` | Cook parsed and stored the token |
| `auth: external auth provider failed` | Binary exited non-zero or stdout was empty |
| `auth: external auth provider timed out (likely needs interactive auth), killing` | Binary did not exit before the timeout and was killed |
| `auth: failed to start external auth provider` | Command could not be spawned (binary not found) |

### Common fixes

- **"Authentication failed"** -- Run `cook logout` to clear cached credentials, then `cook login` to sign in again.
- **Token expires too quickly** -- Set `auth_token_ttl` or return `expires_in` in your auth provider's JSON output.
- **OIDC redirect fails** -- Ensure your IdP allows loopback redirect URIs (`http://127.0.0.1/callback`).
- **External auth provider not found** -- Check that the `auth_provider_command` path is correct and the binary is executable.
